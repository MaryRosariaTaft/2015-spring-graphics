the way we're going to define stuff in this class:

height - y
width - x
depth - z

boxes: given hwd (all drawn parallel to axes) and top-left-front vertex
       determine 8 verticies
       draw lines

spheres: given center and radius
	 evenly distributed points on the surface using rotated circles
	 lines as always
