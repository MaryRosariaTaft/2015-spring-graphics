gotta start using LaTeX to take notes...

scalar multiplication - constant * matrix

---

matrix multiplication - matrix0 * matrix1

NOT COMMUTATIVE

- num_cols(matrix0) MUST EQUAL num_rows(matrix1)
- num_rows(matrix0 * matrix1) == num_rows(matrix0)
- num_cols(matrix0 * matrix1) == num_cols(matrix1)
- etc. multiply row indicies of one by column indicies of the other for each element of the resulting matrix

multiplicative identity

- indentity matricies are always squares with diagonal 1's and all else 0's
