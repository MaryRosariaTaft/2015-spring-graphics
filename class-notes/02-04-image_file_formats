IMAGE FILE FORMATS

vector - shapes defined mathematically and such; don't lose definition on account of zoom
raster - grid of pixels, each defined

re. raster:
uncompressed - data for every pixel (bmp, tif)
compressed - !above (jpg, png, gif)

lossless* - no data has been lost from original (bmp, tif, png, gif)
lossy - !above (jpg)

*compressed files (images) can be lossless (like zip files); but, png and gif compression is usually good for just computer-generated images, not actual photographs

note: some video compression is carried out by saving pixels which don't change from frame to frame, such that the whole image doesn't have to be refreshed from frame to frame

----

we'll be using NetPBM (raster, uncompressed, lossless)

file format:
- P3
- xres yres
- max color val
(the above is the header for every file)
<list of pixel vals>

example:

P3
10  10
255
255 0 0

(a single red pixel.)
