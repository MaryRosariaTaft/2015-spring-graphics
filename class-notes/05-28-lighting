lost my voice again today. woohooo.

I - color value at any pixel (apply to each rgb value)

I = I_ambient + I_diffuse + I_specular

ambient - equal intensity from all directions
	I_a - color of ambient light (I_r, I_g, I_b)
	    - 0 - 255
	k_a - ambient light constant (amt. of ambient light reflected by an object) (different for each object; can set different k_r, k_g, and k_b)
	    - 0 - 1 (% of light reflected)
	I_ambient = I_a * k_a

diffuse - point-source lighting, matte-finish/scattered-light reflection
	light is reflected in all directions evenly
	compare light vector to surface normal; reflection is inversely proportional to angle between them
		- if light vector and surface normal are normalized, their dot product == cos(angle)
	I_p - color of point-soure light
	I_diffuse = I_p * k_d * cos(angle)

specular - also point-source, but smooth reflection
	 I_diffuse = I_p * k_s * cos^n(angle_between_reflection_vector_and_view_vector)
	 	   = 	       	 (dot_product((2 * normal* dot_product(normal, light_vector) - light_vector - light_vector), view_vector))^n
		   		 ((2N(N_dot_L)-L)_dot_V)^n
